1. CODING CONVENTIONS

  1. C++

    Try to follow google's style guide: https://code.google.com/p/google-styleguide/
    With a few modifications:

      1. Indentation
        Use tabs instead of spaces, any special alignment should be done with a tab width of 4.

      2. Boost libraries
        Boost libraries which provide platform abstraction are allowed.

      3. File names
        The C++ file extension to be used is ".cpp".

      4. Casting
        C style casting should be used when doing void pointer to function pointer conversions
        when dealing dynamic linking.

  2. CMake files

    1. Indentation
      Use two spaces for indentation.

    2. Commands and macros
      Use lower case for commands and put a space between the command and its parameter(s).
      e.g.:
        set (VAR val)

    3. Variables
      Use upper case for variables.

    4. Vim modeline
       The vim modeline "# vim: ts=2:sw=2" should be the last line of each file.
       This helps following the indentation convention.
